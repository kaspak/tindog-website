# About
This is a HTML/CSS/Bootstrap5 demo website for a (fake) mobile app called Tindog. I created this website to learning Bootstrap5 and practice working with more advanced CSS concepts I learned from Angela Yu's Web Development course on Udemy.

# Features
- Stylesheets and fonts from Google, Bootstrap, and FontAwesome
- Title section that includes a header with a dropdown menu that redirect to its appropriate sections
- Includes two download links for android and iOS (does not redirect to any links)
- Carousel testimonial section 
- Different subscription card plans section
- Footer with social icon links (does not redirect to any links)

# What I learned
- Understanding section ids vs. classes and when to use which
- Creating a navigation bar with a hamburger drop-down menu using Bootstrap
- Redirection to different section using ids to link in navigation buttons
- Resizing the website based on different viewports (desktop, mobile)
- z-indexing
- carousel feature with slides, buttons (next, previous), auto-turn (off)
- Bootstrap pricing cards & buttons
